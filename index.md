## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/nodar-k/Code-Portfolio/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/nodar-k/Code-Portfolio/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

# Codes and Code Snippets
### Table of some recent projects and associated code or code snippets
| Project Name  | Project Description | Coding Language |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ü¶ü [Yellow Fever Vaccinations](/codes/Yellow-Fever-Models.Rmd)  | Our team created a multi-host SEIR model to simulate a YFV outbreak and the impacts of vaccination on short and long-term epidemic transmission dynamics. My role specifically was conceptualizing the mathematical models and all the coding in R |  R |
| üíâ [Delayed Vaccinations](/codes/VaxStudy.sas)  | Ongoing ecological study to understand the impacts of delayed vaccinations in low and lower-middle income countries. I am responsible for collaborating on the study design and leading the data analysis and coding. Part of the project is also being completed in R. This portion is just one piece of the larger code. | SAS |
| üè• [NYC COVID-19 Hospitalizations](/codes/NYC-COVID-Hospitalizations.sas)  | One part of a larger midterm where we looked at NYC COVID-19 hospitalizations. The data was pulled directly from the NYC Health GitHub | SAS  |
| ü§ß [Ebola Transmission Dynamics](/codes/Ebola-Model.R)  | Simulated the transmission dynamics of the 2014 West African Ebola Outbreak overall and by countries affected (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone | R  |
| üíâ [Vaccine Uptake and Insurance Coverage](/codes/Vax-Uptake-NHANES.sas)  | Looking at the impact of insurance coverage on Hep A, Hep B, and HPV vaccine uptake using two cycles of NHANES. I primarily did all the analysis and the first run of the SAS code and annotations. | SAS  |
| üíä [PrEP Uptake among cis-gender Black women](/codes/PrepUptake-MetaAnalysis.R)  | A systematic review and proportional meta-analysis on observational studies looking at knowledge of and willingness to uptake PrEP among cis-gender Black women in America. My role was to code and run the meta-analysis. | R |
